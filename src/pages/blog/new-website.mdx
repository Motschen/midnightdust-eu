After years of just having a lame and half broken, useless site, I proudly present my new website.  
I now utilize [Astro](https://astro.build/) to achieve blazing fast performance, eye candy and usefulness at the same time.

The new site is based on [Astro Accessible Starter](https://github.com/markteekman/accessible-astro-starter), making it accessible to everyone from the beginning. It also makes use of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.  
I did however change quite a lot, adding an interactive wiki, dedicated pages for my mods, as well as this cool markdown-based blog.  
The wiki for MidnightLib features a version selector which always lists the latest versions, obtained straight from Modrinth's API.
