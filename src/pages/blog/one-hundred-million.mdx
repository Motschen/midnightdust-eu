### Thank you so much for this incredible milestone 
A few days ago, my mods and resourcepacks have surpassed a total amount of 100 million downloads.  
Words cannot express how grateful I am for everything I've already learned from this modding journey.

<p class="text-center italic">Total Download Numbers on CurseForge & Modrinth</p>  
`83.166.929 + 18.183.667 = 101.350.596`  
Honestly, I couldn't even have dreamt about achieving such a milestone when I started modding a few years ago, yet here I am, still failing to grasp just the dimensions of these numbers.

This is – in large parts – thanks to you and everyone else in my community.  
Thank you for your patience while waiting for ports or bugfixes.  
Thank you a ton for all the creative feature suggestions.  
Thank you for improving upon my work via pull requests and even creating "competing" mods (which brings innovation).  
Thank you for inspiring me!


### A special surprise
One of my most downloaded works is my Better Leaves pack.  
It only uses the vanilla texture, making it work with any texturepack.  
This however comes at the cost of performance, because the model contains a lot of elements.  

For this reason, I've recently created a new, more lightweight version of the pack.  
Better Leaves Lite aims to give you the best performance possible, while still keeping the charme of the regular version.  
It's still work in progress, but it will soon be available alongside the regular pack on Modrinth and CurseForge.  
Though you can already test it and suggest mod compatibility on [GitHub](https://github.com/TeamMidnightDust/BetterLeavesLite) :)
