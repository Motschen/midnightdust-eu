# Puzzle Wiki

Welcome to the Puzzle wiki.  
This documentation will guide you on using our resourcepack-features.  

## Customizable Splashscreen

### Changing the Mojang logo
A classic. Whether you're looking for custom branding for your modpack or just want a sweet kitten on your loading screen,
with Puzzle, the sky is the limit.
Changing the logo is actually pretty easy:
- Modify the example logo to suit your needs. I recommend editing the wide template and splitting it afterwards.
- Place your custom logo in your resourcepack under `assets/minecraft/gui/title/mojangstudios.png`
- If the logo does not look quite right on the splashscreen, follow the next step

### Using custom blending
Blending is the technique used to create the smooth fading-out effect after loading has finished.  
Puzzle lets you define custom blending modes that might fit your logo better than the one used for the vanilla white mojang logo.  
It can be defined in the `assets/minecraft/optifine/color.properties` file.  

```properties
# Define a custom blend mode
# The fields src, dst, srcA and dstA can be one of: 
#   ZERO, ONE, SRC_COLOR, ONE_MINUS_SRC_COLOR, DST_COLOR, ONE_MINUS_DST_COLOR, 
#   SRC_ALPHA, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, DST_ALPHA, ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA, SRC_ALPHA_SATURATE
screen.loading.blend=<src dst srcA dstA>
# We recommend this one in most cases: 
screen.loading.blend=SRC_ALPHA ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA ONE ZERO
``` 
```properties
# You can also just disable blending altogether (though it doesn't look good)
screen.loading.blend=off
```

### Entering the world of color
The world would be a sad place without colors.  
That's why Puzzle allows you to customize them to your heart's content.  
Custom colors can be defined in the `assets/minecraft/optifine/color.properties` file.

```properties
# The background color
screen.loading=1e1e2e

# Color of the animated progress bar
screen.loading.progress=f38ba8
# Color of the loading bar outline
screen.loading.outline=cdd6f4
# The background color of the loading bar.
# Remove this if you want it to be transparent
screen.loading.bar=313244
```

  <p>
    <strong>Info:</strong> Colors have to be defined using hex color codes.
    You can use websites like <strong>[this](https://redketchup.io/color-picker)</strong> one to find nice hex color codes.  
    The example colors are based on the <strong>[Catppuccin Mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin)</strong> color pallette.

### Adding a custom background
Looking to show off your Minecraft world or some nice art you drew?  
Well, I have a feeling you might quite like this one.  
Unlike OptiFine, Puzzle allows you to add a custom background to the splashscreen.  
To do so, simply place your custom background at `assets/minecraft/puzzle/splash_background.png`

    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Use <strong>[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php)</strong> to quickly convert and resize images. Once you've learned how to use it, you will love it.  
    I used this single command to convert the example image from JPG to PNG and compress it from 39MB (8K PNG) to just 1.8MB (HD PNG):  
    `magick splash_background.jpg -resize 12.5% splash_background.png`
