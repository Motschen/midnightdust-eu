# Better Leaves Wiki

Welcome to the Better Leaves wiki.
This documentation aims to help you create your own flavour for any texturepack or mod.

## Getting Started <Difficulty difficulty="easy" />
First of all, you need to download the contents of the GitHub repository.
To do so, you can either download the [zip file](https://github.com/TeamMidnightDust/BetterLeavesLite/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), or just execute
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TeamMidnightDust/BetterLeavesLite.git
```
in a terminal window.

## Texturepacks <Difficulty difficulty="easy" />
You can easily create a build for any texturepack.
Just add the pack (as a .zip file or folder) to the input/texturepacks/ folder.
After that, follow the <a href="#building">Building</a> section to get your flavour!

<center><img alt="An overview of the input folder" src="/betterleaves/input-folder.png" width="500"></img></center>
<p class="text-center italic">The input folder is all you have to worry about</p>

## Mods <Difficulty difficulty="easy" />
In simple cases, it is enough to put the mod file in the /input/mods folder and continue with the <a href="#building">Building</a> section.

<center><img alt="An overview of the input/mods folder, showing the automatic unpacking process" src="/betterleaves/mods-unpacking.png" width="500"></img></center>
<p class="text-center italic">Put the .jar file into input/mods, and the script will take care of extracting all textures with "leaves" in their name.
<br/>The _temp folder is purely symbolic here, it will only exist for a few milliseconds during the extraction process.</p>

## Building <Difficulty difficulty="medium" />
To build your flavour of the pack, you need to have Python installed on your system.
You can get it on any modern operating system.

<CustomTabs tabs={[{
    name: `Windows`,
    id: 'windows',
    icon: 'simple-icons:windows',
    active: true
}, {
    name: `Linux`,
    icon: 'linux',
    id: 'linux'
}, {
    name: `MacOS`,
    icon: 'simple-icons:apple',
    id: 'macos'
}]}>
    <div id="windows" data-active="true">
      Download the latest stable Python 3 release from the official <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">website</a><br/>
      or using winget in PowerShell:
      <br/>
      ```bash
      winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.13.1
      ```
    </div>
    <div id="linux" class="hidden">
      On most systems, Python should already be installed by default.<br/>
      Else, just install Python using your distro's package manager.
      <br/>
      Arch Linux:
      ```bash
      pacman -S python
      ```
    </div>
    <div id="macos" class="hidden">
      In case you haven't already, install Homebrew according to the <a href="https://brew.sh/">official instructions</a>.<br/>
      Now, you can just install python using the following command:
      <br/>
      ```bash
      brew install python
      ```
    </div>
</CustomTabs>

Now that you have python installed, head back into the BetterLeavesLite directory.
Here, you should now open a terminal window and run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To build the pack, execute the script using the following command:
```bash
python3 gen_pack.py 1.0 Your Edition
```
Replace "1.0" with your desired version number and "Your Edition" with the name you'd like to appear in the resourcepack description ingame.
And in no time, the script will generate a ready-to-use zip file with your desired content.

## Irregularities and Missing Textures <Difficulty difficulty="advanced" />
If you see missing textures when trying your freshly-built pack, the mod you're adding support for has a more complicated asset structure.
In these cases, you unfortunately have to manually configure exceptions in the /input/overrides.json file.
```json
{
    // Leaves that should not be tinted based on the biome they're in
    "noTint": [
        "minecraft:azalea_leaves",
        "minecraft:flowering_azalea_leaves"
    ],
    // For mods that add leaf carpets/piles, you need to map them to the respective leaf block
    "leavesWithCarpet": {
        "terrestria:sakura_leaves": "terrestria:sakura_leaf_pile"
    },
    // If a mod uses a different texture for the block compared to the item
    "blockTextures": {
        "biomesoplenty:rainbow_birch_leaves": "minecraft:block/birch_leaves"
    },
    // For leaf blocks that use multiple textures (typically used for fruit leafs)
    "overlayTextures": {
        "biomesoplenty:pine_leaves": "biomesoplenty:block/pine_leaves_overlay"
    },
    // For blocks that are named differently from their texture
    "blockIds": {
        "terrestria:japanese_maple_leaves_dark": "terrestria:dark_japanese_maple_leaves"
    },
    // Define the respective Dynamic Trees addon namespace for any mod
    "dynamicTreesNamespaces": {
        "minecraft": "dynamictrees",
        "aether": "dtaether"
    },
    // Force-generate (non-bushy) item models for various blocks
    "generateItemModels": [
        "biomesoplenty:rainbow_birch_leaves",
        "betterend:lacugrove_leaves"
    ],
    // Specify blocks that share the same models
    "blockStateCopies": {
        "minecraft:oak_leaves": [
            "twilightforest:twilight_oak_leaves",
            "dynamictrees:oak_undergrowth_leaves"
        ]
    },
    // A list of textures that will not be treated as leaf blocks (useful for texture stitching)
    "compileOnly": [
      "minecraft:block/snow"
    ]
}
```

## The .betterleaves.json format

### Block States <Difficulty difficulty="advanced" />
Sometimes, you want models to only apply to specific block states.

This is also useful in cases where you want to combine multiple leaf variant textures into a single blockstate file (in that case, set state to "").
`input/assets/eternal_starlight/northland_leaves.betterleaves.json`:
```json
{
    "blockStateData": {
        "block": "eternal_starlight:northland_leaves",
        "state": "snowy=false"
    }
}
```

### Sprite Overrides <Difficulty difficulty="advanced" />
You can override the sprites used in the model. Currently, top and bottom faces of the leaf model will default to the regular texture, but can be overridden this way.

`input/assets/eternal_starlight/northland_leaves_snowy.betterleaves.json`:
```json
{
    "spriteOverrides": {
        "top": "minecraft:block/snow",
        "bottom": "eternal_starlight:block/northland_leaves"
    }
    ...
}
```

### Texture Stitching <Difficulty difficulty="hard" />
Some leaves have textures that consist of different halves â€“ for example Blue Wisteria Leaves from Environmental.
This is where texture stitching comes in.
<center><img style="image-rendering: pixelated" alt="Showcase of the texture stitching layout" src="/betterleaves/demo_blue_wisteria_leaves_top.png" width="400"></img></center>
<p class="text-center italic">Texture stitching allows you to use custom sub-textures while generating the bushy texture</p>

`input/assets/environmental/blue_wisteria_leaves_top.betterleaves.json`:
```json
{
    "textureStitching": {
        "1-3": "environmental:block/wisteria_leaves",
        // Unspecified parts will use the regular leaf texture
        "7-9": "environmental:block/blue_wisteria_leaves"
    }
    ...
}
```
