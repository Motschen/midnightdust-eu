# Better Leaves Lite Wiki

Welcome to the Better Leaves Lite wiki.  
This documentation aims to help you create your own flavour for any texturepack or mod.  

## Getting Started
First of all, you need to download the contents of the GitHub repository.  
To do so, you can either download the [zip file](https://github.com/TeamMidnightDust/BetterLeavesLite/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), or just execute
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TeamMidnightDust/BetterLeavesLite.git
```
in a terminal window.

## Texturepacks
You can easily create a build for any texturepack.  
Just add the pack to the input/texturepacks/ folder.  
After that, follow the <a href="#building">Building</a> section to get your flavour!

## Mods
In simple cases, it is enough to put the mod file in the /input/mods folder and continue with the <a href="#building">Building</a> section.  
If you see missing textures when trying your freshly-built pack, the mod has a more complicated asset structure.  
In these cases, you unfortunately have to manually configure exceptions in the /input/overrides.json file.  
```json
{
    // Leaves that should not be tinted based on the biome they're in
    "noTint": [
        "minecraft:azalea_leaves",
        "minecraft:flowering_azalea_leaves"
    ],
    // For mods that add leaf carpets/piles, you need to map them to the respective leaf block
    "leavesWithCarpet": {
        "terrestria:sakura_leaves": "terrestria:sakura_leaf_pile"
    },
    // If a mod uses a different texture for the block compared to the item
    "blockTextures": {
        "biomesoplenty:rainbow_birch_leaves": "minecraft:block/birch_leaves"
    },
    // For leaf blocks that use multiple textures (typically used for fruit leafs)
    "overlayTextures": {
        "biomesoplenty:pine_leaves": "biomesoplenty:block/pine_leaves_overlay"
    },
    // For blocks that are named differently from their texture
    "blockIds": {
        "terrestria:japanese_maple_leaves_dark": "terrestria:dark_japanese_maple_leaves"
    },
    // Define the respective Dynamic Trees addon namespace for any mod
    "dynamicTreesNamespaces": {
        "minecraft": "dynamictrees",
        "aether": "dtaether"
    }
}
```

## Building
To build your flavour of the pack, you need to have Python installed on your system.  
You can get it on any modern operating system.  

<CustomTabs tabs={[{
    name: `Windows`,
    id: 'windows',
    icon: 'simple-icons:windows',
    active: true
}, {
    name: `Linux`,
    icon: 'linux',
    id: 'linux'
}, {
    name: `MacOS`,
    icon: 'simple-icons:apple',
    id: 'macos'
}]}>
    <div id="windows" data-active="true">
      Download the latest stable Python 3 release from the official <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">website</a><br/>
      or using winget in PowerShell: <br/>
      ```bash
      winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.13.1
      ```
    </div>
    <div id="linux" class="hidden">
      On most systems, Python should already be installed by default.<br/>
      Else, just install Python using your distro's package manager.  
      Arch Linux:
      ```bash
      pacman -S python
      ```
    </div>
    <div id="macos" class="hidden">
      In case you haven't already, install Homebrew according to the <a href="https://brew.sh/">official instructions</a>.<br/>
      Now, you can just install python using the following command:
      ```bash
      brew install python
      ```
    </div>
</CustomTabs>

Now that you have python installed, head back into the BetterLeavesLite directory.  
Here, you should now open a terminal window and run  
```bash
python3 gen_pack.py yourversionname
```
And in no time, the script will generate a ready-to-use zip file with your specified name.
