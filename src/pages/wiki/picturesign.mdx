### Placing a picture
This mod works using signs to store picture information, making it 100% client-sided â€“ the mod works on every server!  
To start, place a picture and click on the icon in the bottom-right.  
Great! You have now opened the helper interface. Here, you can add a URL to your desired media and customize various options!

### Using GIFs, video and audio
To use the Multimedia capabilities of this mod, first make sure you have installed the [WATERMeDIA](https://modrinth.com/mod/watermedia) mod, as well as [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) on your system.  
These components allow the video and audio support of PictureSign to work properly.  
GIF support does not neccessarily need VLC, just WATERMeDIA. 

### Setting up pictures
Pictures can come from various sources:  
- Websites (Recommended): [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), [ImgBB](https://ibb.co/), [PictShare](https://pictshare.net/), [Freeimage](https://iili.io/)
  - Only these websites will work by default. This is a security measure.
- Resourcepack Textures: Use prefix <span class="bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-r from-green-500 to-blue-500 font-mono">rp:</span> (".png" is optional)
  - Texture from Vanilla: e.g. "rp:textures/block/diamond_block.png"
  - Texture from a Mod: e.g. "rp:picturesign:textures/gui/sprites/icon/picturesign"
- Local files: Use prefix <span class="bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-r from-green-500 to-blue-500 font-mono">file:</span>
  - File in your Minecraft folder: e.g. "file:./config/picturesign/image.png"
  - File on your Hard drive: e.g. "file:C:/Users/Motschen/Pictures/image.png" (Windows) or "file:/home/motschen/Pictures/image.png" (Linux/MacOS)

### Setting up GIFs
GIFs can currently only come from one source:  
- Websites: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), [Tenor](https://tenor.com/)
  - Only these websites will work by default. This is a security measure.

### Setting up videos and audios
Multimedia can currently only come from one source:  
- Websites: [YouTube](https://youtube.com/), [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/)
  - Only these websites will work by default. This is a security measure.

### (Advanced) Changing multimedia properties via JSON
You can specify a volume as well as setting custom start and end times for multimedia using json files.  
An example JSON would look like this:
```json
{
  "url": "https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ",
  "volume": "100",
  "start_at": "0:18",
  "end_at": "1:00"
}
```

Upload your JSON file to one of the following sources:
- Websites: [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/), [JSON Keeper](https://www.jsonkeeper.com/), [n:point](https://npoint.io/), [JSONsilo](https://jsonsilo.com/)
  - Only these websites will work by default. This is a security measure.
